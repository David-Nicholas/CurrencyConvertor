# CurrencyConvertor

This project has been implemented using Java in Android Studio. It is a Currency Converter tool that is powered by an API which retrieves up-to-date exchange rates for the currencies that the user desires to convert. The converter ensures accuracy and ease of use and has over 150 currencies available to choose from.
